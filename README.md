## About <a name = "about"></a>

The goal of this project is to experiment using Q-learning to beat a Pong game program.
This will include programming the Q-learner, choosing hyper parameters, and quantizing the
state. The assignment comprises of writing a Python-based simulation, and then a report
which analyzes and explains the results.

To get started, follow their respective instructions.

## Requirements <a name = "installing"></a>


Before running the programs, you should first create a conda environment, load it, and install the requirements
like so:

```ShellSession
$ conda create -n q_learning_pong python=3.8
$ conda activate q_learning_pong
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running the code <a name = "run"></a>

In order to run the code, first, make sure you are in the correct virtual environment:

```ShellSession
$ conda activate q_learning_pong

$ which python
/home/drkostas/anaconda3/envs/q_learning_pong/bin/python

```

Now, in order to train the agent you can call the [Q_Learning.py](Q_Learning.py)
directly.

```ShellSession
$ python Q_Learning.py grid_dem alpha epsilon num_episodes check_freq file_name [agent_type]
```

Then, to test the agent you can call the [runEpisode.py](runEpisode.py)
directly.

```ShellSession
$ python runEpisode.py grid_dem file_name
```
